Project Spyn -- ZoomMe 
An autonomous lego vehicle programmed to transport a person in a wheelchair from a specific point to another. 


Project Spyn is about building and programming an autonomous vehicle that aims to transport wheelchaired individuals from a starting location to an end location.
Our project is named ZoomMe. Our vehicle, which we made with legos, is powered by sensors (color, ultrasonic, touch) and a brick where we will send the programming to. 

**Installation**
1. Install Matlab software
2. Install EV3 Toolbox folder
    - In order to properly install the toolbox in Matlab, unzip and put the unzipped Toolbox folder in C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R(year)\toolbox
    - In Matlab, go to home --> set path --> click the EV3 toolbox in the Matlab program files folder
    - *Macs are not recommended for this program, as it is impossible to set the path*
3. Connect your EV3 device wirelessly to your computer
4. Import the files in the repo into Matlab
5. Put your brick's name on the brick.ConnectBrick(''); command
6. Run
